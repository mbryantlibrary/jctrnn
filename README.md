# JCTRNN

Implements a continuous time recurrent neural network (CTRNN) in Java. Layouts, connections and parameters can be specified as a JSON file, which is parsed into a network layout. Specific parameters can be set, creating a high performance CTRNN object which integrates each step.

See Beer, R.D. (1995). On the dynamics of small continuous-time recurrent neural networks. and also http://mypage.iu.edu/~rdbeer/ for the C code on which this implementation is based.
